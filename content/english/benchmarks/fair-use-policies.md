In May 2022, LDBC's Board of Directors has approved the following fair use policies.

> The term “LDBC Benchmark result” or any equivalent phrase shall be permitted by licence of the LDBC trademarks on the term LDBC BENCHMARK solely for use in referring to properly audited benchmark results, published on the LDBC website. Such results will include price metrics, and are the only test results that should be used for product or service comparisons involving tests which refer to draft or approved standard LDBC benchmark specifications.
>
> Only members of LDBC can be test sponsors for audited benchmark tests.
>
> Test sponsors must have the written permission of the producer, owner or head licensor of the rights to use, of a product or service that is part of the system under test in an audited benchmark test. The results of a test that is conducted without such permission are, by definition, not LDBC benchmark results.
>
> Any other work that uses or implements (in part or in whole) or is inspired by or derived from one of the LDBC Benchmark Standards, including the publication of benchmark test results that are partial or claim to be complete but are not audited, must be prominently described in any public statement, publication or forum as not being an LDBC Benchmark result, and if space permits (for example in press releases, blogs, web pages, white papers, academic papers, etc.) shall be accompanied by a brief but complete description of the ways and degrees in which the work relates to/departs from/extends/implements LDBC Benchmark Standards, and a description of the work’s purpose.
>
> Descriptive notices described in point 4) are the responsibility of the authors or publishers of the work, and must not imply that the work is in any way endorsed by LDBC. No such work can include price metrics. If the work contains performance or functional test results of any kind then its descriptive notice must make it clear that the work cannot be used for the purpose of product comparisons involving tests which refer to draft or approved standard LDBC benchmark specifications.
>
> A breach of the requirements in points 4) and 5) may cause the author or publisher of the work or any publicity relating to the work to infringe LDBC’s trademarks on the term LDBC BENCHMARK, trademarks which LDBC intends to actively protect.
>
> In the interim to publish the points of policy enumerated in part C of this motion on the website and on the LDBC Basecamp site, along with a notice of the existence of the registered or applied-for trademarks and the jurisdictions concerned. To likewise publish Marton’s report.
>
> The existing pages for publication of audited results shall be supplemented by a page for linking all known and future references to LDBC Benchmark inspired or derived work, which are not LDBC benchmark results, with descriptive notices as defined in C 4) above, by the authors of each work posted, and any other information that will give a reader a fair and complete view of the way in which the benchmark specs are being used.
>
> The members of LDBC shall immediately be bound by these policies, and are asked to promptly provide links and descriptive notices for the website for any significant existing publication relating to LDBC benchmarks that is not an LDBC benchmark result.
