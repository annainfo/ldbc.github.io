The LDBC consortium is pleased to announce its Eighth Technical User
Community (TUC) meeting.


This will be a two-day event at [Oracle Conference
Center](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/rdb/hqcc-dir-134199.pdf) in Redwood Shores facility on **Wednesday and Thursday June 22-23/06, 2016.**

This will be the second TUC meeting after the finalisation of the LDBC
FP7 EC funded project. The event will basically set the following
aspects:

-   Two day event with one day devoted to User\'s experiences and one
    day devoted to benchmarking
    experiences.
-   Presentation of the benchmarking results for the different
    benchmarks.
-   Interaction with the new LDBC Board of Directors and the  LDBC
    organisation
    officials. 

We welcome all users of RDF and Graph technologies to attend. If you are
interested, please, contact Damaris Coll (UPC) at  <damaris@ac.upc.edu>;
in order to notify Oracle security in advance, registration requests
need to be in by **June 12**.

In the agenda, there will be talks given by LDBC members and LDBC
activities, but there will also be room for a number of short 20-minute
talks by other participants. We are specifically interested in learning
about new challenges in graph data management (where benchmarking would
become useful) and on hearing about actual user stories and scenarios
that could inspire benchmarks. Further, talks that provide feedback on
existing benchmark (proposals) are very relevant. But nothing is
excluded a priori if it is graph data management related. Talk proposals
can be forwarded to Damaris as well and will be handled by Peter Boncz
(<boncz@cwi.nl>) and Larri
([larri\@ac.upc.edu](mailto:larri@ac.upc.ed)}).

Further, we call on you if you or your colleagues would happen to have
contacts with companies that deal with graph data management scenarios
to also attend and possibly present. LDBC is always looking to expand
its circle of participants in TUCs meeting, its graph technology users
contacts but also eventually its membership base.

##### **Getting there** 

###### **Driving directions** 

-   [Southbound] **-** Take Highway 101 South (toward San Jose) to
    the Ralston Ave./Marine World Parkway exit. Take Marine World
    Parkway east which will loop you back over the freeway. Make a left
    at the first light onto Oracle Parkway. 350 Oracle Parkway will be
    on the right.
-   [Northbound] **-** Take Highway 101 North (toward San
    Francisco) to the Ralston Ave./Marine World Parkway exit. Take the
    first exit ramp onto Marine World Parkway. Make a left at the first
    light onto Oracle Parkway. 350 Oracle Parkway will be on the right.

##### **Parking**

The Conference Center has a designated parking lot located directly
across from the building. If the lot is filled there is also additional
parking in any of the parking garages located near by. No parking
permits are needed.

##### **Public transport** 

Take the Caltrain to either San Carlos or Hillsdale and take the free
Oracle shuttle from there. Get off the Oracle shuttle at 100 Oracle
Parkway (second stop) and walk 5 minutes to get to the Conference
Center.

-   Caltrain
    timetables: [http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/weekdaytimetable.html](http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/weekdaytimetable.html)
-   Oracle Shuttle
    timetables: [http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/Shuttles/Oracle_Shuttle.html](http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/weekdaytimetable.html)

You can also take the Caltrain to Belmont and walk 23 min, instead of
taking the Oracle shuttle.

Alternatively, SamTrans (San Mateo County\'s Transit Agency) provides
public bus service between the Millbrae BART station and Palo Alto with
three stops on Oracle Parkway - one of which is directly in front of
the Oracle Conference Center.
