LDBC is pleased to announce its Ninth Technical User Community (TUC) meeting. 

This will be a two-day event
at [SAP Headquarters](https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/~sapidp/011000358700001204882013E.pdf) in
Walldorf, Germany on February 9+10, 2017

 This will be the third TUC meeting after the finalisation of the LDBC
FP7 EC funded project. The event will basically set the following
aspects:

-   Two day event with one day devoted to User\'s experiences and one
    day devoted to benchmarking
    experiences.
-   Presentation of the benchmarking results for the different
    benchmarks.
-   Interaction with the new LDBC Board of Directors and the LDBC
    organisation
    officials. 

We welcome all users of RDF and Graph technologies to attend. If you are
interested, please, contact Damaris Coll (UPC) at <damaris@ac.upc.edu>;

In the agenda, there will be talks given by LDBC members and LDBC
activities, but there will also be room for a number of short 20-minute
talks by other participants. We are specifically interested in learning
about new challenges in graph data management (where benchmarking would
become useful) and on hearing about actual user stories and scenarios
that could inspire benchmarks. Further, talks that provide feedback on
existing benchmark (proposals) are very relevant. But nothing is
excluded a priori if it is related to graph data management. Talk
proposals can be forwarded to Damaris as well and will be handled by
Peter Boncz (<boncz@cwi.nl>) and Larri
([larri\@ac.upc.edu](mailto:larri@ac.upc.ed){.external-link}).

Further, we call on you if you or your colleagues would happen to have
contacts with companies that deal with graph data management scenarios
to also attend and possibly present. LDBC is always looking to expand
its circle of participants in TUCs meeting, its graph technology users
contacts but also eventually its membership base.

 

### Agenda

In the TUC meeting there will be

-   updates on progress with LDBC benchmarks, specifically the Social
    Network Benchmark (SNB) and its interactive, business analytics and
    graphalytics workloads.
-   talks by data management practitioners highlighting graph data
    management challenges
-   selected scientific talks on graph data management technology

The  meeting will start on Thursday morning,  with a program from
09:00-18:00, interrupted by a lunch break.

Thursday evening (19:00-21:00) there will be a **social dinner** in
Heidelberg.

Friday morning the event resumes from 9:00-12:00. In the afternoon,
there is a (closed) LDBC Board of Directors meeting (13:00-16:30) at the
same venue.

##### **Venue** 

The TUC meeting will be held in the [SAP
Headquarters](https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/~sapidp/011000358700001204882013E.pdf) at
the SAP Guesthouse Kalipeh (<https://www.kalipeh.com>). The address is:

#### **Getting there**

##### **By plane** 

There are two airports close to SAP's headquarter: Frankfurt Airport
(FRA) and Stuttgart-Echterdingen Airport (STR). The journey from
Frankfurt Airport to SAP headquarters takes\
about one hour by car, while it takes slightly longer from Stuttgart-
Echterdingen Airport. Concerning airfare, flights to Frankfurt are
usually somewhat more expensive than to Stuttgart.

When booking flights to Frankfurt, you should be aware of Frankfurt-Hahn
Airport (HHN), which serves low-cost carriers but is not connected to
Frankfurt Airport. Frankfurt Hahn is ap-\
proximately one hour from the Frankfurt main airport by car.

The journey from Frankfurt Airport to SAP headquarters takes about one
hour by car (95 kilometers, or 59 miles).

Journey time from Stuttgart-Echterdingen Airport to SAP headquarters
takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes by car (115 kilometers, or 71 miles).

###### **Driving directions**

**Traveling from Frankfurt Airport (FRA) to SAP Headquarters**\
Directions to SAP headquarters:\
• When leaving the airport, follow the highway symbol onto
"A3/Würzburg/A5/Kassel/Basel/Frankfurt."\
• Follow the A5 to "Basel/Karlsruhe/Heidelberg."\
• Take exit 39 -- "Walldorf/Wiesloch."\
• Turn left onto B291.\
• Turn right onto Dietmar-Hopp-Allee.\
(Should you use a navigational system which does not recognize the
street name 'Dietmar-Hopp-Allee' please use 'Neurottstrasse' instead.)

**Traveling from Stuttgart-Echterdingen Airport (STR) to SAP
Headquarters**\
To get to SAP headquarters by car, there are two possible routes to
take. The first leads you via Heilbronn and the second via Karlsruhe.
The route via Karlsruhe is a bit shorter yet may be more congested.

Directions to SAP headquarters:\
• When leaving the airport, follow the highway symbol onto
"A8/Stuttgart/B27."\
• Stay on A8 and follow the sign for "Karlsruhe/Heilbronn/Singen/A8."\
• Follow A8 to Karlsruhe.\
• Take exit 41 -- "Dreieck Karlsruhe" to merge onto A5 toward
"Frankfurt/Mannheim/Karlsruhe/Landau (Pfalz)."\
• Take exit 39 -- "Walldorf/Wiesloch."\
• Turn left onto B291.\
• Turn right onto Dietmar-Hopp-Allee.

###### **Parking** 

The closest parking lot to the event location is P7 (see figure above).

##### **By Train** 

As the infrastructure is very well developed in Europe, and in Germany
in particular, taking the train is a great and easy way of traveling.
Furthermore, the trains usually run on time, so this mode of travel is
very convenient, especially for a group of people on longer journeys to
major cities.

**From Frankfurt Airport (FRA) to SAP Headquarters**\
Directions to SAP headquarters:\
• Go to Terminal 1, level T (see overview in Appendix).\
• Go to the AIRail Terminal -- "Fernbahnhof" (long-distance trains).\
• Choose a connection with the destination train station
"Wiesloch--Walldorf".\
• From station "Wiesloch--Walldorf," take bus number 707 or 721 toward
"Industriegebiet Walldorf, SAP." It is a 10-minute ride to reach bus
stop 'SAP headquarters'.

**From Stuttgart-Echterdingen Airport (STR) to SAP Headquarters**\
Directions to SAP headquarters:\
• Go to the S-Bahn station in the airport, following the sign (station
is called "Stuttgart Flughafen/Messe").\
• Take train number S2 or S3 to "Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof" (main
station).\
• From Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof choose a connection with the destination
train station "Wiesloch--Walldorf".\
• From station "Wiesloch--Walldorf," take bus number 707 or 721 toward
"Industriegebiet Walldorf, SAP". It is a 10-minute ride to reach bus
stop 'SAP headquarters'.
