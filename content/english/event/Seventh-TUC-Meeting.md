The LDBC consortium is pleased to announce its Seventh Technical User
Community (TUC) meeting.

This will be a two-day event at [IBM\'s TJ
Watson](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson)
facility on **Monday and Tuesday November 9/10, 2015.**

This will be the first TUC meeting after the finalisation of the LDBC
FP7 EC funded project. The event will basically set the following
aspects:

-   Two day event with one day devoted to User\'s experiences and one
    day devoted to benchmarking
    experiences.
-   Presentation of the benchmarking results for the different
    benchmarks.
-   Interaction with the new LDBC Board of Directors and the  LDBC
    organisation
    officials.

We welcome all users of RDF and Graph technologies to attend. If you
are interested, please, contact Damaris Coll (UPC) at
 <damaris@ac.upc.edu>; in order to notify IBM security in advance,
registration requests need to be in by Nov
1.

In the agenda, there will be talks given by LDBC members and LDBC
activities, but there will also be room for a number of short 20-minute
talks by
other participants. We
are specifically interested in learning about new challenges in graph
data management (where benchmarking would become useful) and on hearing
about actual user stories and scenarios that could inspire benchmarks.
Further, talks that provide feedback on existing benchmark (proposals)
are very relevant. But nothing is excluded a priori if it is graph data
management related. Talk proposals can be forwarded to Damaris as well
and will be handled by Peter Boncz (<boncz@cwi.nl>) and Larri
([larri\@ac.upc.edu](mailto:larri@ac.upc.ed)).

Further, we call on you if you or your colleagues would happen to have
contacts with companies that deal with graph data management scenarios
to also attend and possibly present. LDBC is always looking to expand
its circle of participants in TUCs meeting, its graph technology users
contacts but also eventually its membership
base.
