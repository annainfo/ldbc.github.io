    day devoted to benchmarking
    experiences.

    benchmarks.

    LDBC organisation
    officials.

    presentations.

##### Getting there 

**Flying:** Barcelona airport is situated 12 km from the city. There are
several ways of getting from the airport to the centre of Barcelona, the
cheapest of which is to take the train located outside just a few
minutes walking distance past the parking lots at terminal 2 (there is a
free bus between terminal 1 and terminal 2, see this [map of the
airport](http://goo.gl/maps/iJqlj)). It is possible to
buy 10 packs of train tickets which makes it cheaper. Taking the bus to
the centre of town is more convenient as they leave directly from
terminal 1 and 2, however it is more expensive than the train.

**Rail:** The Renfe commuter train leaves the airport every 30 minutes
from 6.13 a.m. to 11.40 p.m. Tickets cost around 3€ and the journey to
the centre of Barcelona (Sants or Plaça Catalunya stations) takes 20
minutes.

**Bus:** The Aerobus leaves the airport every 12 minutes, from 6.00 a.m.
to 24.00, Monday to Friday, and from 6.30 a.m. to 24.00 on Saturdays,
Sundays and public holidays. Tickets cost 6€ and the journey ends in
Plaça Catalunya in the centre of Barcelona.

**Taxi:** From the airport, you can take one of Barcelona\'s typical
black and yellow taxis. Taxis may not take more than four passengers.
Unoccupied taxis display a green light and have a clearly visible sign
showing LIBRE or LLIURE. The trip to Sants train station costs
approximately €20 and trips to other destinations in the city cost
approximately €25-30.

**Train and bus:** Barcelona has two international train stations: Sants
and França. Bus companies have different points of arrival in different
parts of the city. You can find detailed information in the following
