This will be a one-day event at the [VLDB 2017](http://www.vldb.org/2017) conference in
Munich, Germany on September 1, 2017.

Topics and activities of interest in these TUC meetings are:

-   Presentation on graph data management usage
    scenarios.
-   Presentation of the benchmarking results for the different
    benchmarks, as well as the graph query language task force.
-   Interaction with the new LDBC Board of Directors and the LDBC
    organisation officials.

We welcome all users of RDF and Graph technologies to attend. If you are
interested to attend the event, please, contact Adrian Diaz (UPC) at
<adiaz@ac.upc.edu> to register; registration is free, but required.

In the agenda, there will be talks given by LDBC members and LDBC
activities, but there will also be room for a number of short 20-minute
talks by other participants. We are specifically interested in learning
about new challenges in graph data management (where benchmarking would
become useful) and on hearing about actual user stories and scenarios
that could inspire benchmarks. Further, talks that provide feedback on
existing benchmark (proposals) are very relevant. But nothing is
excluded a priori if it is related to graph data management. Talk
proposals are handled by Peter Boncz (<boncz@cwi.nl>) and Larri
([larri\@ac.upc.edu](mailto:larri@ac.upc.ed)).

Further, we call on you if you or your colleagues would happen to have
contacts with companies that deal with graph data management scenarios
to also attend and possibly present. LDBC is always looking to expand
its circle of participants in TUCs meeting, its graph technology users
contacts but also eventually its membership base.

### Agenda

In the TUC meeting there will be:

-   updates on progress with LDBC benchmarks, specifically the Social
    Network Benchmark (SNB) and its interactive, business analytics and
    graphalytics workloads.
-   talks by data management practitioners highlighting graph data
    management challenges
-   selected scientific talks on graph data management technology

The  meeting will start on Friday morning, with a program from 10:30-17:00

    board of directors, but this meeting is not public.

### Venue

The Technical University of Munich (TUM) is hosting that week the [VLDB
conference](http://www.vldb.org/2017); on the day of the
TUC meeting the main conference will have finished, but there will be a
number of co-located workshops ongoing, and the TUC participants will
blend in with that crowd for the breaks and lunch.

The TUC meeting will be held in in **Room
2607** alongside the VLDB workshops that
day (MATES, ADMS, DMAH, DBPL and BOSS).

**address: Technische Universität München (TUM), Arcisstraße 21, 80333
