LDBC is pleased to announce its Twelfth Technical User Community (TUC) meeting. 

LDBC Technical User Community meetings serve to (1) learn about progress
in the LDBC task forces on graph benchmarks and graph standards, (2) to
give feedback on these, and (3) hear about user experiences with graph
data management technologies or (4) learn about new graph technologies
from researchers or industry -- LDBC counts Oracle, IBM, Intel, Neo4j,
TigerGraph and Huawei among its members.

This TUC meeting will be a one-day event on the last Friday
of **[SIGMOD/PODS 2019](https://sigmod2019.org/)** in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in the conference venue of **[Beurs van Berlage](http://sigmod2019.org/conf_venue)**. The room is the Mendes da Silva kamer. Please check its tips for **[accommodation in Amsterdam](http://sigmod2019.org/accommodation)**.

Note also that at SIGMOD/PODS in Amsterdam on Sunday, June 30, there is a research workshop on graph data management technology called [GRADES-NDA 2019](https://sites.google.com/site/gradesnda2019), that
may be of interest to our audience (this generally holds for the whole
SIGMOD/PODS program, of course).

We welcome all users of RDF and Graph technologies to attend. If you are
interested to attend the event, please, contact Damaris Coll (UPC)
at <damaris@ac.upc.edu> to register;

**=\> registration is free, but required \<=**

You need to be registered in order to get into the SIGMOD/PODS venue.
Friday, July 5, is the final, workshop, day of SIGMOD/PODS, and the LDBC
TUC meeting joins the other workshops for coffee and lunch.

In the agenda, there will be talks given by LDBC members and LDBC
activities, but there will also be room for a number of short 20-minute
talks by other participants. We are specifically interested in learning
about new challenges in graph data management (where benchmarking would
become useful) and on hearing about actual user stories and scenarios
that could inspire benchmarks. Further, talks that provide feedback on
existing benchmark (proposals) are very relevant. But nothing is
excluded a priori if it is related to graph data management.

**Talk proposals can be sent to Peter Boncz** (boncz@cwi.nl), who is
also the local organizer. **Please also send your slides to this email
for archiving on this site.**

Further, we call on you if you or your colleagues would happen to have
contacts with companies that deal with graph data management scenarios
to also attend and possibly present. LDBC is always looking to expand
its circle of participants in TUCs meeting, its graph technology users
contacts but also eventually its membership base.

### Agenda

In the TUC meeting, there will be:

-   updates on progress with LDBC benchmarks, specifically the Social
    Network Benchmark (SNB) and its Interactive, Business Intelligence
    and Graphalytics workloads.
-   talks by data management practitioners highlighting graph data
    management challenges and products

The morning slot (08:30-10:30) is reserved for an LDBC Board Meeting, to
which in principle only LDBC directors are invited (that meeting will be
held in the same room).

The  TUC meeting will start on Friday morning after the morning coffee
break of SIGMOD/PODS 2019 (**room: Mendes da Silva kamer**):
