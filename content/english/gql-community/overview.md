LDBC's working groups investigate research questions on graph query languages including the upcoming [ISO GQL language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Query_Language). We currently have three groups:

* [Property Graph Schema Working Group](/gql-community/pgswg)
* [Existing Languages Working Group](/gql-community/elwg)
* [Formal Semantics Working Group](/gql-community/fswg)
