LDBC is proud to announce the new LDBC Graphalytics Benchmark draft
specification.

LDBC Graphalytics is the first industry-grade graph data management
benchmark for graph analysis platforms such as Giraph. It consists of
six core algorithms, standard datasets, synthetic dataset generators,
and reference outputs, enabling the objective comparison of graph
analysis platforms.  It has strong industry support from Oracle, Intel,
Huawei and IBM, and was tested and optimized on the best industrial and
open-source systems.

Tim Hegeman of [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl) is today presenting the
technical paper describing LDBC Graphalytics at the important
[VLDB](https://www.vldb.org/conference.html) (Very Large DataBases)
conference in New Delhi, where his talk also marks the release by LDBC
of Graphalytics as a benchmark draft. Practitioners are invited to read
the PVLDB paper, download the software and try running it.

LDBC is eager to use any feedback for its future adoption of LDBC
Graphalytics.
