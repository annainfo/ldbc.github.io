LDBC is presenting two papers at the next edition of the ACM SIGMOD/PODS
conference held in Melbourne from May 31st to June 4th, 2015. The annual
SCM SIGMOD/PODS conference is a leading international forum for database
researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore
cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools and
experiences.

On the industry track, LDBC will be presenting the *Social Network
Benchmark Interactive Workload* by Orri Erling (OpenLink Software), Alex
Averbuch (Neo Technology), Josep Larriba-Pey (Sparsity Technologies,
Hassan Chafi (Oracle Labs), Andrey Gubichev (TU Munich), Arnau Prat
