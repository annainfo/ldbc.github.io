Next 31st of  May the GRADES workshop will take place in Melbourne within the ACM/SIGMOD presentation. GRADES started as an initiative of the Linked Data Benchmark Council in the SIGMOD/PODS 2013 held in New York. 

Among the papers published in this edition we have "Graphalytics: A Big Data Benchmark for Graph-Processing Platforms", which presents a new benchmark that uses the Social Network Benchmark data generator of LDBC (that can be found in https://github.com/ldbc) as the base to execute the algorithms used for the benchmark, among which we have BFS, community detection and connected components. We also have "Microblogging Queries on Graph Databases: an Introspection" which benchmarks two of the most significant Graph Databases in the market, i.e. Neo4j and Sparksee using microblogging queries on top of twitter data. We can finally mention "Frapp√©: Querying the Linux Kernel Dependency Graph" which presents a framework for querying and visualising the dependencies of large C/C++ software systems.

Meet you in Melbourne!
